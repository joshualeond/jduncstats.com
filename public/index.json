Select out all the rows in the Howell1 data with ages below 18 years of age.

Present and interpret the estimates. For every 10 units of increase in weight, how much taller does the model predict a child gets?\n fit \u0026lt;- rethinking::map( alist( height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), # likelihood mu \u0026lt;- a + b * weight, # linear model a ~ dnorm(156, 100), # prior b ~ dnorm(0, 10), # prior sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) # prior ), data = d3 ) Let’s look at the results of this model:\npost_early \u0026lt;- extract.samples(fit) precis(post_early) ## Mean StdDev |0.89 0.89| ## a 58.24 1.39 56.09 60.54 ## b 2.72 0.07 2.61 2.83 ## sigma 8.43 0.43 7.72 9.09 So we see for every 1 unit increase in weight a child should be 2.72 cm taller. Or as the question has asked 10 unit increase is a 27.2 cm increase in height. For every 22 lb increase there is a corresponding ~1 foot increase in height.\n (b)  Plot the raw data, with height on the vertical axis and weight on the horizontal axis.

Describe the kinds of assumptions you would change, if any, to improve the model. You don’t have to write any new code. Just explain what the model appears to be doing a bad job of, and what you hypothesize would be a better model.\n Well the model appears to be doing good job with the data at hand. The prior’s were set for persons age \u0026gt; 18 so these should be adjusted. Something of conrern is that you see a non-linear structure in this data. So the two tails of the data are not covered well by the model. This non-linearity could be accounted for with a polynomial regression or with splines.\n  4H3. Suppose a colleague of yours, who works on allometry, glances at the practice problems just above. Your colleague exclaims, “That’s silly. Everyone knows that it’s only the logarithm of body weight that scales with height!” Let’s take your colleague’s advice and see what happens.\n(a)  Model the relationship between height(cm) and the natural logarithm of weight (log-kg). Use the entire Howell1 data frame, all 544 rows, adults and non-adults. Fit this model, using quadratic approximation:\n \\[ \\begin{aligned} h_i \\sim \\text{Normal}(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\\\ \\mu_i = \\alpha + \\beta \\text{log}(w_i) \\\\ \\alpha \\sim \\text{Normal}(178, 100) \\\\ \\beta \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, 100) \\\\ \\sigma \\sim \\text{Uniform}(0, 50) \\end{aligned} \\] where \\(h_i\\) is the height of individual \\(i\\) and \\(w_i\\) is the weight (in kg) of individual \\(i\\). The function for computing a natural log in R is just log. Can you interpret the resulting estimates?\nfit_all \u0026lt;- rethinking::map( alist( height ~ dnorm(mu, sigma), mu \u0026lt;- a + b * log(weight), # linear model a ~ dnorm(178, 100), b ~ dnorm(0, 100), sigma ~ dunif(0, 50) ), data = d ) Now the model is fit let’s review the coefficients.\nprecis(fit_all) ## Mean StdDev 5.5% 94.5% ## a -23.78 1.34 -25.92 -21.65 ## b 47.08 0.38 46.46 47.69 ## sigma 5.13 0.16 4.89 5.38 plot(precis(fit_all)) When the weight is low or equivalent to 1 then the height would be -23 which is not insightful. Given that this is a log-level model we can interpret our \\(\\beta\\) as a one percent increase in weight corresponds to a \\(\\beta/100 = 47.08/100\\) unit increase in height.\n (b) Begin with this plot:\nplot(height ~ weight, data = d, col = col.alpha(rangi2, 0.4)) Then use the samples from the quadratic approximate posterior of the model in (a) to superimpose on the plot: (1) the predicted mean height as a function of weight, (2) the 97% HPDI for the mean, and (3) the 97% HPDI for predicted heights.\nweight.seq \u0026lt;- seq(2, 65, by = 1) all_samp \u0026lt;- link(fit_all, data = data.frame(weight = weight.seq)) ## [ 100 / 1000 ] [ 200 / 1000 ] [ 300 / 1000 ] [ 400 / 1000 ] [ 500 / 1000 ] [ 600 / 1000 ] [ 700 / 1000 ] [ 800 / 1000 ] [ 900 / 1000 ] [ 1000 / 1000 ] all_mu \u0026lt;- apply(all_samp, 2, mean) all_mu.HPDI \u0026lt;- apply(all_samp, 2, HPDI, prob = 0.97) all_sim \u0026lt;- sim(fit_all, data = data.frame(weight = weight.seq)) ## [ 100 / 1000 ] [ 200 / 1000 ] [ 300 / 1000 ] [ 400 / 1000 ] [ 500 / 1000 ] [ 600 / 1000 ] [ 700 / 1000 ] [ 800 / 1000 ] [ 900 / 1000 ] [ 1000 / 1000 ] all_sim.HPDI \u0026lt;- apply(all_sim, 2, HPDI, prob = 0.97) plot(height ~ weight, data = d, col = col.alpha(rangi2, 0.4)) # the predicted mean height lines(weight.seq, all_mu) # the 97% HPDI of the mean shade(all_mu.HPDI, weight.seq) # the 97% HPDI for predictions shade(all_sim.HPDI, weight.seq)   ","date":1552270394,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552270394,"objectID":"da743bec7bb56ad1c8927f2d98829e71","permalink":"/post/hw2-ch-4/","publishdate":"2019-03-10T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/hw2-ch-4/","section":"post","summary":"Hard Problems 4H1.

Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.
