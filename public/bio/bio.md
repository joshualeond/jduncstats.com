I'm Josh Duncan, a former controls engineer that found a passion in data science and statistics.

## Studies

 Statistical modeling and uncertainty fascinate me. I'm currently on a Bayesian modeling journey so you'll likely see posts on learning bayes.

### Education

 Louisiana State University:
 
 - Masters degree in Analytics (2015-2017)
 - Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering (2010-2014)

### Tools

I'm a pretty big [`Julia Language`](https://julialang.org/) fanboy but regularly use `R` within my day to day work.

## Family

This is my amazing crew. My wife (Brooke) and our two kids (Priya and Joshua):

## Guitar

Whenever I get exhausted with data science I enjoy the classical guitar. This outstanding guitar was built by Bernardo Romero out in San Diego, CA. Anyone interested try to hit him up or check out [GSI](https://www.guitarsalon.com/).
